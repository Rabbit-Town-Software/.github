## 🌱 Who We Are

**Rabbit Town Software** is a tiny, independent software group focused on:
- 🔐 Privacy-respecting apps
- 🎮 Indie games and game engines
- 🛠️ Simple utilities that do one thing well

We believe good software doesn't need bloat, surveillance, or friction.  
Our work is open-source, GPL-licensed, and designed to serve people — not our pockets.
