## Who We Are

**Rabbit Town Software** is a tiny, independent software group focused on:
- Privacy-respecting apps
- Game engines
- Simple utilities that do one thing well

We believe good software doesn't need bloat, surveillance, or friction.  
Our work is open-source, GPL-licensed, and designed to serve people — not our pockets.

## 📬 Contact

We love hearing from other indie devs, artists, and tinkerers.  
Questions? Ideas? Bug reports?
